<h1>This is our game</h1>

<h2>Our game plan</h2>
<p>We will be making a 2d platforming explorer game about a ghost who is wandering around the underworld. They deliver something to someone in the underworld and that is their job. They also aren't really sure what they do, but just living their best ghostly lives.</p>

<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>We want to show how to move, how to interact, and how to sprint in the first mission. This means 3 things. First the user must move in the tutorial, they must interact with a thing, and they must run.</p>
